Open NT is dead, long live FreeNT

## 

FreeNT 3.1 is a more extendable version of Open NT, a project started in the near 2000s and appears to already
be more "unmaintained" than a popular GitHub project.

Similarly the [OpenWindows 11](https://freent-project.github.io/openwindows) OS, created by us, runs on
FreeNT 3.1. OpenWindows replaces Windows with a project that does NOT track you, is more SECURE, and more
LIGHTWEIGHT. OpenExplorer is the file manager UI used by OpenWindows Workstation.

## Development

OpenWindows offers "dev mode" which enables installation of executables without a signature.
If you are here to contribute, enable it.
See the [docs](https://freent-project.github.io/freent31-docs).
