  And ALL CAPS is often seen as yelling, too.

## Bans

### Temporary Ban

These bans will last 1 month of continuous exclusion. They are imposed for calling people "stupid", "idiots", etc, and
not being mindful of desicions, as well as not being mindful of what people consider offensive.

### Permanent Ban

These bans last for an indefinite time. This is used when people don't be mindful of fears and phobias,
or continue performing actions that lead to a temporary ban.

### God's Ban

These bans are similar to permanent bans, but the FreeNT project does not grant violators an unban.
This means the user will never be able to participate in the project, and will never be allowed to.
We impose this for our security and to keep the FreeNT project a safe place.

Reasons for this such ban includes racism, scams, and others. This ban is very rare.
