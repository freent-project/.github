# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for contributing to FreeNT, OpenWindows, or any other project part of the FreeNT family of software!
These are some guidelines you should follow when contributing to FreeNT software.

## Certify the DCO

All FreeNT projects enforce the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
This makes sure everyone understands the word "Free" in the name of "FreeNT" as in freedom. You might
not (unless you're Richard Stallman).

In your commit description, use something like this:

```
Signed-off-by: NT Bot Tim <freent@example.org>
```

Change "NT Bot Tim" to your username, and `freent@example.org` to your email (or GitHub's noreply
if you hide your email).

*Note: NT Bot Tim is not a real person. FreeNT developers made that name up for use as an example
in FreeNT documentation code examples, and is also used in OpenWindows in full name placeholders.*
