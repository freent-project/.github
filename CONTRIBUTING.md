# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for contributing to FreeNT, OpenWindows, or any other project part of the FreeNT family of software!
These are some guidelines you should follow when contributing to FreeNT software.

## Certify the DCO

All FreeNT projects enforce the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
This makes sure everyone understands the word "Free" in the name of "FreeNT" as in freedom. You might
not (unless you're Richard Stallman).

In your commit description, use something like this:

```
Signed-off-by: NT Bot Tim <freent@example.org>
```

Change "NT Bot Tim" to your username, and `freent@example.org` to your email (or GitHub's noreply
if you hide your email).

*Note: NT Bot Tim is not a real person. FreeNT developers made that name up for use as an example
in FreeNT documentation code examples, and is also used in OpenWindows in full name placeholders.*

## What is settings.yml?

Some FreeNT projects have publicly disclosed their GitHub repository settings in a YAML file.
The file is located in `.github/settings.yml`. Unlisted options have not been disclosed and are
still proprietary, unless GitHub publicly discloses them theirselves.

**Most contributors will not need to edit `settings.yml` unless it is a critical change that affects
the repository, or the FreeNT Project altogether, whereas a discussion should be raised at
[our forums](https://github.com/orgs/freent-project/discussions).**
